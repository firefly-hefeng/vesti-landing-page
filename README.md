# Vesti Landing Page

Marketing site for Vesti, a local-first AI conversation memory product.

This repository is the standalone landing-page codebase extracted from the main VESTI project:
[abraxas914/VESTI](https://github.com/abraxas914/VESTI)

## What This Repo Contains

- The public-facing landing page built with Next.js
- Hero, features, demo, install, and footer sections
- Brand assets used by the marketing site
- Chrome Web Store install link and marketing config

This repo does not include the full browser extension, capture engine, local knowledge dashboard, or the rest of the main VESTI product code.

## Product Context

Vesti is a local-first memory layer for AI conversations. It helps users keep the threads they want back by turning scattered chatbot history into a searchable personal library.

The landing page in this repo is focused on explaining that value clearly:

- Local-first AI memory
- Fast recall of past conversations
- Demo of the memory loop
- Install path through the Chrome Web Store

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui primitives

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Production build:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
